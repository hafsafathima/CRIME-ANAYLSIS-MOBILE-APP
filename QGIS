CRIME MAPPING
. Prepare Your Data
You typically need:
a. Crime incident data
CSV, Excel, or shapefile(NEWS PAPERS)(
Should contain:
Latitude & Longitude (preferred)
Crime type
Date/time
Description
Reporting area or precinct
b. Base layers
City boundaries
Roads
Police zones
Census tracts / blocks (optional)
Importing data
Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer → choose CSV → set geometry = lat/lonThis will plot crime points on the map.
Hotspot maps show where crimes concentrate.
Method 1: Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation)
Raster → Heatmap → Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation)
Choose:
Radius (e.g., 500–1000 meters)
Weight field (optional)
Produces a smooth density surface.
Use this if you want the number of crimes per area.
Create polygons (districts or fishnets):Vector → Research Tools → Create grid
Count points in grid:Vector → Analysis Tools → Count points in polygon
This gives a raw crime intensity map.
Crime Density by Population (Risk Mapping)
To analyze crime relative to population:
Import census data (population counts per tract or block).
Join census data to spatial polygons.
Calculate: crime rate = crime count / population × 1,000 or 100,000
Style using graduated colors.
You can automate:
Data cleaning
Heatmap generation
Monthly crime reports
Cluster analysis
QGIS → Processing Model BuilderOr write scripts in PyQGIS.
